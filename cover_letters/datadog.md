# Hello, Datadog

I am Mark Steve Samson and my dream is to build a company that helps developers do their work better. That's why I was delighted to see the __Software Engineer - Developer Efficiency__ role in your jobs listing. Everything in the job description sounds very exciting to me. Potentially being in this role would be a great opportunity for me to experience working in a product and company I truly admire and a huge opportunity for me to learn more about the challenges developers face in a world-class organization.

But do I fit the bill? 

- You like a mix of coding, ops, and wiring together the right low level pieces; whatever’s the best way to solve the problem at hand

  _I'm really good at piecing things together to work how I want it to._

- You’re comfortable diving into new code bases when needed

  _My combined experience in product startups and consultancy allowed me to dive into various types of code bases: from legacy to bleeding edge._

- You know when you can move fast, and which changes need extra care

  _Being an "Activator" is one of my top strengths. I know when and how to move fast while still being critical._

- You have a strong focus and commitment to the evolving needs of engineering teams

  _"Empathy" is another top strength for me. I anticipate need and always try to understand choices that people make._

- You want to work in a fast, high-growth startup environment that respects its engineers and customers 

  _YES!_

As for the bonus points:

- You speak Python and/or Go

  _Python is my main language and I've also experienced developing production services with Go._

- You have experience working on dev tools or a complex CI/CD pipeline

  _A lot of experience._

- You've worked with Docker, Kubernetes, Chef, Terraform, and/or Gitlab before

  _Chef and Gitlab not so much but a solid yes for the rest._

- You have SRE experience

  _I unfortunately haven't had the opportunity to be in this role officially. I am aware of the responsibilities and have experience on certains tasks for this role._

I hope this provides the initial context you would need to consider my application. You can read more about my work experience in my resume.

Thank you and have a good day!
